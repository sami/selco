# Project Overview

Build a **mobile-first, static web application** that helps tradespeople estimate building material quantities through guided, project-based calculation flows mapped to real product ranges (future scope).

**Target audience:** Tradespeople — plumbers, bricklayers, tilers, plasterers, general builders, and anyone buying building materials for a project. The app is designed for on-site use on a mobile phone.

## Core problem

Tradespeople currently rely on manual calculations and scattered online tools to estimate material quantities. No existing solution handles multi-material project estimation or provides contextual guidance.
